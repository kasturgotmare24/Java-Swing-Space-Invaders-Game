# 👾 Space Invaders (Java + Swing)
===============================================================

## 📖 Description

This project is a classic Space Invaders clone, built entirely in Java using Swing for the UI and game rendering. It recreates the nostalgic arcade-style gameplay where the player controls a spaceship to shoot down waves of invading aliens while avoiding their attacks.

The game demonstrates object-oriented design, collision detection, keyboard event handling, animations, and simple 2D graphics rendering in Java.

It’s a great example of a beginner-to-intermediate level Java project that showcases game development fundamentals.
