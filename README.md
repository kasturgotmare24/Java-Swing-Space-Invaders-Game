# Java-Swing-Space-Invaders-Game
This project is a classic arcade game, "Space Invaders Game" recreated using Java Swing. It offers a nostalgic trip back to one of the most iconic video games ever made. The objective is simple yet challenging: you control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, moving left and right to dodge enemy fire and eliminate waves of descending aliens.
